# Crypto Tool Security Information

This document addresses the safety and data privacy aspects of the Crypto Tool, a web-based application for AES encryption and decryption of text.

## Is the Crypto Tool Safe?
Yes, the Crypto Tool is safe to use for its intended purpose of encrypting and decrypting text using AES encryption. Here’s why:

1. **Client-Side Operation**:
   - All encryption and decryption processes occur entirely in your browser using the CryptoJS library. No data is sent to any server, ensuring that your secret key, input text, and output remain on your device.

2. **No External Server Communication**:
   - The tool does not make any network requests (e.g., API calls or data uploads). It relies solely on local JavaScript execution, Tailwind CSS, and Font Awesome, all loaded via secure CDNs.

3. **Trusted Libraries**:
   - **CryptoJS**: A widely used, open-source library for cryptographic operations, loaded from a reputable CDN (Cloudflare).
   - **Tailwind CSS** and **Font Awesome**: Used for styling and icons, with no data collection mechanisms.
   - All libraries are loaded over HTTPS, reducing the risk of tampering.

4. **Transparent Code**:
   - The source code (`index.html`) contains no hidden scripts, tracking code, or malicious functionality. You can review it to verify its safety.

5. **Secure Clipboard Usage**:
   - The copy/paste features use the browser’s Clipboard API, which operates within a secure browser sandbox and only accesses data you explicitly copy or paste.

## Does It Steal Data?
No, the Crypto Tool does not steal any data. Key points include:

1. **No Data Storage**:
   - The tool does not store your secret key, input text, or output text in local storage, cookies, or elsewhere. Data exists only in memory during your session and is cleared when you close or refresh the page.

2. **No Tracking or Analytics**:
   - There are no tracking scripts or analytics libraries that collect user data (e.g., IP addresses, browser details, or usage patterns).

3. **User-Controlled Input**:
   - All data (secret key and input text) is provided by you and processed locally. The output is displayed in the browser and can be copied only at your request.

## Potential Risks and Mitigations
While the tool is safe, consider these best practices to ensure secure usage:

1. **Secret Key Security**:
   - Use a strong, unique secret key to protect your encrypted data. Do not share it publicly, as anyone with the key can decrypt your data.
   - Be cautious when copying/pasting the key to avoid exposing it in insecure environments.

2. **Browser Security**:
   - Use a trusted, up-to-date browser to prevent vulnerabilities from malicious extensions or scripts.
   - Avoid running the tool on a compromised device with potential malware that could monitor clipboard activity.

3. **CDN Dependency**:
   - The tool uses CDN-hosted libraries. While these are from reputable sources, you can download the libraries locally for added control.
   - Optionally, add Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes to verify CDN files.

## Recommendations for Safe Use
- Run the tool in a secure context (HTTPS or localhost) to ensure clipboard features work securely.
- Review the `index.html` code to confirm it contains no unexpected scripts.
- Use a strong secret key and store encrypted outputs securely.
- Operate the tool on a trusted device and browser, avoiding insecure channels for sensitive data.
- For maximum security, run the tool offline by downloading the required libraries.

## Conclusion
The Crypto Tool is designed to be safe and privacy-respecting. It processes all data client-side, uses trusted libraries, and includes no mechanisms for data collection or transmission. By following best practices, you can use it confidently for AES encryption and decryption.
